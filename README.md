At FPG, we have had to process a lot of crypto data. Because it's core to us, we want to test your familiarity with ORMs, Databases, and Async/Threads.

You'll see in this enclosed folder a CSV. We'd like you to upload this CSV.

We will remind you that the interview is 45 minutes long. Please give an estimate on which steps you believe you can reach.

The steps we'll take are:

Prepare a database. If you don't have a database ready, you can create an in-memory data structure representing the DB.

Choose an ORM (or do it in SQL) and create the table to store CSV data.

Deserialize the data.

Save these records row-by-row first into the database. Do some simple data checks.

Write code to read the newly inserted row. Feel free to use threads, async, etc

Increase Isolation Level to the highest.

Will there be issues with increasing isolation level?
